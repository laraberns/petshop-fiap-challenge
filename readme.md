# FIAP - HTML and Bootstrap Challenge

To solidify the learning content on HTML and Bootstrap, it is crucial to practice creating web pages and applications. Additionally, explore the functionalities provided by these technologies, such as inserting elements, creating forms, styling with classes, and applying a grid.

With this intention, we propose a challenge in which we will put into practice all the knowledge acquired during the course to build a new web page, from construction with HTML to styling with Bootstrap. Let's get started?

## Objective
Create a web application to promote a pet shop using HTML and Bootstrap, always based on the Figma layout.

## Description
You will need to create a website with HTML and style it with Bootstrap. To access the layout that you should use as a base, [click here](https://on.fiap.com.br/mod/conteudoshtml/view.php?id=357557&c=9977&sesskey=HIqsmQ8drT).

The site should have a header with the company logo and links to the "about," "services," and "scheduling" sections.

The first section will not be accessible through the header and will feature a welcome text with an image of a family and their pet. The second section will be "About Us," where there will be an image of a veterinarian with a dog and a text about the company's creation.

Next, we will produce the "Services" section, which should list the following services provided by the company: bath, grooming, consultations, adoption, and daycare.

After that, there will be the "Schedule your appointment" section, which will include a form to provide data such as name, phone, and the type of desired service. Next to the form, there should be a table with the opening hours of the pet shop.

Finally, create a footer with credits for those who developed the site and icons for the company's social media. Remember to keep it similar to the Figma layout and apply responsive utility classes.
